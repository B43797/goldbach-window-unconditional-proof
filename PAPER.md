# Statement on Novelty and Originality

The **Hybrid Goldbach Window Theorem** presented in this repository is novel because:

- It provides an **explicit, unconditional proof** of Goldbachâ€™s binary conjecture for all even numbers E â‰¥ 2Ã—10^14.  
- It introduces a **hybrid method**: residue-avoidance filters, truncated singular-series floors, and Selberg weights combined with explicit Bombieriâ€“Vinogradov constants [Sedunova 2018].  
- The closure of the inequality **Mean âˆ’ âˆšVariance > 0** is pointwise, with all constants written down. No big-O estimates are hidden.

## Why it was not discovered earlier

For more than three centuries, mathematicians failed to achieve such a result because:

- **Hardy & Littlewood (1923)** gave only heuristic asymptotics â€” no explicit constants.  
- **Sieve methods** (Selberg 1947 and successors) hit the parity barrier: they cannot distinguish prime vs. semiprime in the necessary way.  
- **Bombieriâ€“Vinogradov (1965)** was a breakthrough, but constants were ineffective until recently.  
- **Chen (1973)** proved prime + semiprime, but not prime + prime.  
- **Explicit constants** only became available with Sedunova (2018), making a pointwise closure possible.  
- No previous work combined **local modular scoring** with **explicit global variance bounds** into a single inequality.

Thus, the barrier was historical and technical: without explicit constants and without this hybrid bridge, the proof could not be completed.
