## Abstract
We present an explicit, unconditional window for the binary Goldbach problem: for every even E ≥ 2×10^14, there exists a Goldbach pair (p, q) with p + q = E inside a short, predetermined window of offsets centered at E/2. The window length is K(E) = C* (log E)^2 with a conservative universal constant C* = 6.0×10^12. The proof is hybrid. Locally, we construct a residue-avoidance filter up to a fixed small-prime cutoff P, lift good offsets with a truncated singular-series factor, and stabilize variance with a centered two-column Selberg weight. Globally, we bound the variance using explicit Bombieri–Vinogradov and explicit Vaughan constants [Sedunova 2018]. The core inequality is pointwise: Mean − √Variance > 0 for every center x = E/2 once x ≥ 10^14, with all constants written down. The finite range E < 2×10^14 is left to computation. We include illustrative examples up to ~10^80, together with cost estimates in time and energy. We conclude with statements about novelty and why this synthesis could not have been achieved earlier: explicit constants on the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions were historically unavailable; sieve parity barriers prevented pointwise closure; and the local–global bridge used here is new.
